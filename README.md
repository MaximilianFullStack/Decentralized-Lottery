# Lottery-Project

This is my first Dapp project. 

  1. EnterLottery: 
     This function's purpose is to enter a user's address into the list of contestants (entries array).
     It takes a value of 1e17 wei (0.1 eth) to enter the lottery.
     And doesnt let user in if the lottery is closed, the user doesnt have enough ETH, or the user's address is already in the list of contestants.
